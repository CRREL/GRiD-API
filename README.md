The GRiD API v3 is documented in [swagger.v3.yaml](swagger.v3.yaml). (Note that the API spec contains several template variables, e.g., `{{ URL_ROOT }}`, that will cause tools such as the Swagger Editor to throw errors. These need to be customized depending on which instance of GRiD you are accessing.)

GRiD also provides a WFS endpoint for querying point cloud and raster data. This is documented in [wfs.rst](wfs.rst).
